# C-Data-Structure
In the previous section, you have seen how OOP principles can be used to create useful abstractions in your code. A Person class produces objects with a reliable set of values and methods that a Person can possess and perform. Any issue or feature in the code-base surrounding Person may use a Person to solve that problem or implement that feature. If the scope of this Person class is too narrow to solve a particular problem, we may decide to define a new class to solve that problem specifically - or - we may choose define something more abstract: to solve the problem in question, but also similar problems with an ideally wide scope.  There have emerged, in the world of computer science, a shared set of ways to solve common problems in software: Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hashes - fundamental building blocks we call data structures.
